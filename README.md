## Real-time Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio using FFT

This code simulates real-time spectrum sensing for a cognitive radio system using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). It generates a simulated available spectrum and performs FFT analysis to visualize spectrum occupancy and identify potential channels for transmission.

**Features:**

* Simulates spectrum occupancy with three sinusoidal signals representing different frequencies.
* Calculates the FFT of the simulated spectrum to obtain its frequency domain representation.
* Plots both the time-domain (available spectrum) and frequency-domain (spectrum sensing) representations for visual analysis.

**Requirements:**

* MATLAB https://www.mathworks.com/

**Instructions:**

1. **Save the code:** Save the provided code as a `.m` file (e.g., `spectrum_sensing.m`).
2. **Run the code:** Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the saved file. Execute the script using the `run` command:

   ```matlab
   run spectrum_sensing.m
